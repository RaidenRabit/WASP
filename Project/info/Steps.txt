1. Export all files from access to csv (done manualy, but maybe possible to automize)
Data cleaning:
2. Combine all csv files in one (run- CreateOneFile.py, changes needed depending on encoding)
3. Clean the resulting file, by removing columns(run- ModifyData.py)
4. Dealing with missing values (run- DealWithNaN.py)
